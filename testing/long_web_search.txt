Haz: Alright, thanks for joining, everyone. We have a few things to cover today—feature prioritization, outreach strategy, and some research tasks. Let's start with product updates. Wyatt, where are we with the onboarding improvements?

Wyatt: We've simplified the initial sign-up flow, but we still need to tweak the email verification process. Right now, too many users drop off before verifying their accounts.

Lisa: Yeah, we discussed sending a follow-up email 24 hours later. Did we finalize that messaging?

Wyatt: Not yet. Lisa, can you take a pass at it?

Lisa: Sure. I'll draft something that reminds users about verification and highlights what they're missing if they don't complete the process.

Haz: Perfect. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task for that.

Lisa: Another thing—we should track how many people verify after that second email. Do we have analytics set up for that?

Wyatt: Not yet, but I can add an event to track verification clicks from the reminder email.

Haz: Good idea. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task to set up that tracking.

Lisa: Since we're talking about onboarding, we also need to figure out the best CTA for the dashboard. Right now, it's just a generic "Get Started" button, but we could personalize it based on what the user has done so far.

Wyatt: That's a great point. Maybe something like "Complete Your Profile" if they haven't, or "Explore Features" if they've finished setup.

Haz: I like that. Can we A/B test different CTAs?

Wyatt: Yeah, we just need to set up an experiment for it.

Haz: Let's do it. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task for A/B testing dashboard CTAs.

Lisa: Okay, moving on to outreach. We need to expand our reach, especially within startup communities. Have we made progress on partnerships?

Wyatt: I reached out to a few coworking spaces, but we should also look at startup accelerators. They might be interested in using our tool for their founders.

Haz: Good call. Let's compile a list of accelerators and see which ones make sense to target.

Lisa: Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task for that.

Wyatt: Also, we talked about hosting a small event to get early adopters engaged. Maybe a live demo or Q&A session?

Haz: That's a great idea. We need a venue, a date, and a rough agenda.

Lisa: I can start looking at spaces. Maybe something in a coworking space?

Wyatt: Yeah, that would fit our audience well.

Haz: Let's get a list of potential locations. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task to research venues for our event.

Lisa: One more thing—I heard there might be some hackathons happening in SF this weekend. That could be a great place to meet developers and potential users.

Wyatt: Good thinking. If there's one focused on AI or startups, that's even better.

Haz: Let's find out what's happening. Hey ElevenLabs, please do a web search for what hackathons are happening in SF this weekend.
