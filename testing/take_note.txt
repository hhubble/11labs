Alex: Alright, let’s get started. First up—product updates. Jordan, where are we with the new dashboard redesign?

Jordan: The main UI components are done, but we still need to refine the mobile layout. Some elements aren’t scaling properly.

Lisa: Should we prioritize mobile-first, or just make sure it’s responsive?

Jordan: I’d say make sure it’s responsive first. Then we can optimize further if needed.

Alex: Sounds good. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task to finalize mobile responsiveness for the dashboard.

Lisa: Next, for outreach—have we scheduled the next batch of customer interviews?

Jordan: Not yet. We need to finalize the list of users to reach out to.

Alex: Let’s get that sorted. Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task to compile a list of users for interviews.

Lisa: Also, we should send a follow-up email to the last batch we spoke with—maybe a quick thank-you and an update on their feedback being implemented?

Alex: Good idea. Hey ElevenLabs, please send an email thanking users for their feedback and sharing our latest updates.

Jordan: One more thing—have we locked in the date for our next internal planning session?

Lisa: Not yet. We should align on that today.

Alex: Let’s set a tentative date for Friday. We can adjust if needed.

Lisa: Hey ElevenLabs, please take a note: Next internal planning session tentatively set for Friday.
