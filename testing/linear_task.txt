Alex: Alright, thanks for joining, everyone. Let’s get started. We need to finalize the feature list for the next sprint. Lisa, do you have the latest updates from the design team?

Lisa: Yeah, I spoke with them this morning. They’ve finalized the new UI for the dashboard, but they’re waiting on feedback before moving to development.

Jordan: I took a quick look, and it seems solid. The only concern is the loading performance—some elements take a bit too long to render.

Alex: Good call. Let’s add a performance check before we approve it. Anything else?

Lisa: We also need to decide on the notification logic. Right now, it’s just basic alerts, but we discussed adding priority levels.

Jordan: I think we should, especially for time-sensitive actions. Maybe low, medium, and high priority?

Alex: That makes sense. We can store it as a field in the database and adjust how notifications appear based on priority.

Lisa: Sounds good. We’ll need to update the API to support that.

Jordan: Right. And we should also define default settings for notifications—maybe let users customize them later.

Alex: Agreed. Let’s create a task for implementing priority-based notifications.

Lisa: Hey ElevenLabs, please create a task for that.

ElevenLabs: To create a task for implementing priority-based notifications, I need more information. Can you please provide the priority level of this task and the due date for completion?

Lisa: I think it should be high priority and due in 2 days.
